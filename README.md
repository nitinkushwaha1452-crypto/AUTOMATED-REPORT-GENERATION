# DESCRIPTION:-
Internship Task-2: Automated Report Generation Using Python
📌 Project Description

As part of Internship Task-2 at CODTECH, this project focuses on developing an Automated Report Generation system using Python. The main objective of this task is to design and implement a Python script that can read data from a file, analyze the data, and generate a well-formatted PDF report automatically. This task demonstrates practical skills in file handling, data processing, and document generation, which are essential in real-world software development and data analysis roles.
The project uses Python libraries such as FPDF or ReportLab to generate professional PDF reports programmatically. These libraries allow precise control over text formatting, layouts, fonts, headings, tables, and page structure, making the generated reports suitable for business and academic use.
🎯 Objectives
The primary objectives of this project are:
To read structured data from an external file (such as a text file or CSV file).
To perform basic data analysis, including calculations like totals, averages, counts, or summaries.
To automatically generate a PDF report containing analyzed results.
To create a reusable and scalable script that can handle different datasets.
To gain hands-on experience in automated document generation.
🛠️ Tools and Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Development Environment: Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
Libraries:
FPDF or ReportLab (for PDF generation)
Built-in Python libraries for file handling and data processing
⚙️ Working Methodology
The script begins by reading data from an input file. This file may contain numerical or textual data structured in rows and columns. After successfully loading the data, the script processes it to extract meaningful insights, such as summaries, statistics, or trends.
Once the analysis is complete, the script creates a PDF report. The report includes:
A title and header section
Data summary and analysis results
Proper formatting such as fonts, spacing, and alignment
Page numbering and structured layout
This automated approach eliminates the need for manual report creation and ensures consistency and accuracy.
📂 Deliverables
Python Script: A complete script that reads data, analyzes it, and generates a PDF report.
Sample PDF Report: A generated report demonstrating the script’s functionality.
GitHub Repository: Contains the script, sample data file, generated report, and documentation.
🌟 Conclusion
This project highlights the importance of automation in report generation and showcases the power of Python in handling real-world tasks efficiently. By completing this task, I gained valuable experience in data analysis, file handling, and PDF creation. The skills developed through this project are highly relevant for roles in data analytics, software development, and automation engineering.
